Main file where ctkrender is called to run the Custom Tkinter window and the translation and file handling.
I wanted to try working with multiple files since I wished to learn to write cleaner, more efficient code. 
I am doing my best to learn, and will continue to do so however messy and unprofessional this code may be.
